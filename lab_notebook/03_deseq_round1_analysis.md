# Analysis of Deseq Round 1 results

## Upset plots
For visualizing how much sharing of orthogroups there is between species for hibernation-related genes.
- separate plots for upregulated (positive log2FoldChange) and downregulated (negative log2FoldChange) genes
- combine each tsv into one file, adding species and tissue columns:
~~~
cd /Users/annenakamoto/ROTATION2/DESEQ2/DE_GENES
echo -e "species\ttissue\tgene_name\tgene_id\tOrthogroup\tbaseMean\tlog2FoldChange\tlfcSE\tstat\tpvalue\tpadj\tIHW_pvalue" > ALL.DEgenes.tsv
ls *.*.DEgenes.tsv | while read tsv; do
    sp=$(echo ${tsv} | awk -v FS="." '{ print $1; }')
    ts=$(echo ${tsv} | awk -v FS="." '{ print $2; }')
    awk -v s=${sp} -v t=${ts} -v OFS="\t" '!/log2FoldChange/ { print s, t, $0; }' < ${tsv} >> ALL.DEgenes.tsv
done

- R Notebook for making upset plots: [upsetplot.Rmd](https://github.com/aanakamo/kelleylab_rotation/blob/main/scripts/upsetplot.Rmd)
    - Added separate (subsetted) plots for: (filtering script: [filter_pav.py](https://github.com/aanakamo/kelleylab_rotation/blob/main/scripts/filter_pav.py))
        1. OGs with at least one gene from each species
        2. OGs with zero genes from one or more species
            - Separated by clade for OGs with zero genes from one or more species: (Bear, bat clade); (Lemur, squirrel, hamster clade)

### All species
Not subsetted

All DE genes

Upregulated DE genes
![All species, UPregulated DE genes](supporting_images/ALL_species.UP.upset.png)
Downregulated DE genes
![All species, UPregulated DE genes](supporting_images/ALL_species.DOWN.upset.png)

Notes:
- there seem to be ~3,000 OGs that contain both up and downregulated genes

## GO analysis
For investigating differences in hibernation-related gene function when shared across species and unique to species.

- First need to add the human proteome to the OrthoFinder results, to map human GO terms to the other species proteins
    - mapping script: [map_humanGO.py](https://github.com/aanakamo/kelleylab_rotation/blob/main/scripts/map_humanGO.py)
- Using [clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) gseGO() to find enriched terms
- R Notebook for making GO dotplots: [upsetplot.Rmd](https://github.com/aanakamo/kelleylab_rotation/blob/main/scripts/upsetplot.Rmd)
    - for each shared tissue, make dotplots for genes from shared OGs, and dotplots for genes from OGs unique to a species
    - each plot is separated by upregulated (activated) and downregulated (suppressed)

### All GO dotplots
See here for all GO dotplots:

### Gene trees
Observation: many OGs contain both up and down regulated genes. Take a look at some of these
